This will be a reimplementation of the game Singularity ( https://github.com/SoPra18-07/Singularity ) in Rust using [amethyst](https://amethyst.rs/). Also inspired from [Achikaps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yio.tro.achikaps).

Stage: implementing parts / prototyping.


## How to run

To run the game, simply use `cargo run`. A recent rust installation is recommended. Make sure to have the [amethyst dependencies](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst#dependencies) installed.

On macOS: `cargo run --no-default-features --features "metal"`.

## Progress

There is progress ongoing (at least on the `develop`-branch, which you might want to check out.

A plan of things I intend to implement (which is one of my initial plans for this project) can be found in the [PLAN.md](https://github.com/singularity-rs/singularity-rs/blob/master/PLAN.md).

Take a look at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/singularity-rs/singularity-rs/issues) or the [Project](https://github.com/singularity-rs/singularity-rs/projects/1?fullscreen=true) how the progress is in detail (it is likely to be more frequently updated than the plan). If something is not clear, feel free to ask for clarification.
